Welcome to the [Tour Operator Vehicles extension](https://www.lsdev.biz/lsx/extensions/tour-operator/vehicles/).

If you haven't yet had the chance to [install and configure the Tour Operator Plugin](https://www.lsdev.biz/lsx/extensions/tour-operator/), you should do that before proceeding here! 

To help convince travellers of their comfort and safety when traveling with you, we’ve created the [Vehicles extension](https://www.lsdev.biz/lsx/extensions/tour-operator/vehicles/).

Fill in your fleets’ specs and display your vehicles on connected tours and  destinations. 

With a range of avaiable options such as; type and number of gears, engine type (petrol/diesel), number of seats, vehicle code, and of course images and copy.
